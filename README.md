## Name
RPG Battle Tower

## Description
A Text-based game with gameplay like a turn-based RPG. You climb floors of an endless battle tower, fighting randomly generated enemies as you go. You choose between attacking, defending, or using items. Every five floors you encounter a boss. Upon defeating the boss, you level up and get a stat boost in all areas, and get to choose a further boost in one area from three randomly generated choices. Makes use of numerous Object-Oriented Programming concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, and method overloading + overriding.
